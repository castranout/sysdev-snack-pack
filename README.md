# 🧰 sysdev-snack-pack

Welcome to my sysadmin lunchbox—where you'll find a curated collection of Python mini-projects for system automation, monitoring, and command-line mischief. Each "snack" is a standalone script with real-world utility and a sprinkle of fun.

🍴 Built while working through CS50x, Python certifications, and my path to becoming a SysDev Engineer at Amazon.
